# Toilethereum Litepaper

## Introduction
Toilethereum ($TOILETH) is a humorous ERC20 memecoin built on the Ethereum blockchain. It combines fun, utility, and community-driven governance to create a unique memecoin experience. The project merges parody with practical concepts, encouraging users to engage with blockchain in a playful way.

## Concept

### Flush to Earn
The Flush to Earn mechanism allows token holders to participate in playful interactions while earning rewards. Users can engage with the system by performing certain actions (metaphorically "flushing") and receive $TOILETH tokens as incentives. This concept emphasizes community interaction and fun.

### NFT Collection
Toilethereum offers a limited NFT collection that ties into the Flush to Earn ecosystem. NFTs provide collectible value and additional rewards, promoting engagement with the token and the community.

### DAO Governance
Holders of $TOILETH can participate in governance decisions through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). This ensures that the community has a voice in key decisions, such as tokenomics adjustments, NFT drops, and ecosystem developments.
