# Vision â€” Toilethereum

## 1. Introduction

Toilethereum (TOILETH) is an ERC-20 memecoin on the Ethereum network that combines gamification, NFT integration, and decentralized governance through a DAO. The project is designed as a self-sustaining ecosystem that encourages active community participation, rewards interactions via the Flush to Earn mechanism, and enables democratic decision-making for the ecosystem's future development.

## 2. Flush to Earn

Flush to Earn is the core engagement mechanism of the ecosystem. It allows users to participate in interactive activities and receive rewards in TOILETH tokens and NFTs.

### 2.1 User Activities

- Participation in challenges and tasks within the dApp  
- Voting in polls and proposals  
- Community interactions, including NFT design suggestions and meme submissions

### 2.2 Reward System

- Each validated activity generates rewards in TOILETH tokens and/or NFTs  
- Batch transactions reduce gas costs while smart contracts ensure reward distribution

### 2.3 Technical Workflow

- Off-chain events are collected and validated via signed transactions  
- Batch settlement enables multiple rewards in a single on-chain transaction  
- Reward distribution and deflation mechanisms (buyback and burn) are executed through smart contracts

## 3. NFT Integration

NFT collections are an integral part of the ecosystem.

### 3.1 Utility

- Boost Flush to Earn rewards  
- Provide access to exclusive events  
- Grant governance roles within the DAO for specific NFT types

### 3.2 Gamification

- NFT combinations unlock additional challenges and rewards  
- NFT activation, burning, and upgrading are integrated with tokenomics

### 3.3 Technical Notes

- ERC721 standard with additional reward multiplier functionality  
- Off-chain metadata storage for visual flexibility and gas optimization

## 4. DAO and Governance

The DAO allows the community to make decisions on key aspects of the ecosystem.

### 4.1 Decision Process

- Proposals are initiated on a forum or via Snapshot signaling  
- Validated proposals are submitted on-chain for voting  
- Timelock and multisig mechanisms ensure security

### 4.2 Governance Topics

- Development of new features and integrations  
- Planning NFT collections and reward structures  
- Flush to Earn parameter adjustments  
- Long-term ecosystem strategies

### 4.3 Technical Implementation

- On-chain smart contracts handle proposal creation and vote execution  
- Off-chain snapshots optimize gas costs  
- Timelock and multisig patterns secure larger transactions and critical changes

## 5. Tokenomics and Deflation Mechanisms

- Dynamic emission: rewards are adjusted based on ecosystem activity and metrics  
- Deflation: buyback and burn mechanisms and sink contracts control circulating supply  
- Reward pool integration: tokens reserved for Flush to Earn and NFT rewards

### 5.1 Technical Implementation

- Buyback and burn smart contracts automatically purchase TOILETH from secondary markets and send to a burn address  
- Sink contracts accept ERC-20 tokens, swap them for TOILETH, and either burn them or add to the reward pool  
- Batching and relayer patterns optimize gas costs for multiple reward payouts in a single transaction

## 6. Roadmap

- Phase 1: Launch TOILETH token on Ethereum  
- Phase 2: Implement Flush to Earn mechanism  
- Phase 3: Release NFT collection integrated with rewards  
- Phase 4: Activate DAO governance for community decisions  
- Phase 5: Explore additional blockchain integrations and partnerships

## 7. Security and Audit

- All smart contracts are open-source  
- Third-party audits are performed before major releases  
- Proxy patterns and upgradeable contracts with timelocks ensure secure changes  
- All buyback, burn, and reward transactions are transparent and auditable

## 8. UX and Onboarding

- Intuitive dApp with wallet connection  
- Reward status tracker, flush history, and NFT gallery  
- Tutorial modules for onboarding new users and educating them on Flush to Earn, NFT utility, and DAO processes
